# mini-lambda

![mini-lambda CLI demo](cli.png)

## Overview

`mini-lambda` is a lightweight, Rust-powered serverless compute platform for running WebAssembly in distributed workers over gRPC.

## Key features

- **Serverless WASM execution:** Runs WebAssembly components on remote workers using Wasmtime with WASI Preview 2 support.
- **Ahead-of-time compilation:** Modules are compiled once on the worker and cached by content hash, no repeated JIT overhead.
- **Distributed worker pool:** Workers register dynamically with the orchestrator over gRPC; the orchestrator queues and dispatches jobs across them.
- **Credit-based scheduling:** Workers advertise available capacity; the orchestrator uses credits to load-balance without oversubscribing any node.
- **Full job lifecycle:** Jobs move through Queued → Dispatched → Compiling → Executing → Completed / Failed / Cancelled. Cancellation is supported at any stage.
- **Optional authentication:** Password-protected access per role (client, worker), with JWT-based job authorization between orchestrator and worker.
- **TUI dashboard:** Run the orchestrator with `--tui` for a live terminal dashboard; sortable job, worker, and client tables with integrated log viewer.

## Architecture

The client sends a job request to the orchestrator, which queues it until a worker with sufficient capacity is available. The orchestrator then assigns the job to a worker and returns the worker's address along with a JWT scoped to that job. The client uses these to connect directly to the worker, sending the `.wasm` bytes and arguments, and receiving the final result. The orchestrator maintains a persistent bidirectional gRPC stream with each worker for job dispatch and status updates.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Rust toolchain (`rustup`).

1. **Start the orchestrator:**
   ```bash
   cargo run -p orchestrator -- 127.0.0.1:50051
   ```

2. **Start one or more workers** (each needs a bind host and an initial credit count):
   ```bash
   cargo run -p worker -- 127.0.0.1 100
   ```

3. **Submit a job:**
   ```bash
   cargo run -p client -- crates/client/test-wasm/test-wasm.wasm
   ```

Workers register with the orchestrator and accept jobs from clients directly. Running locally with `127.0.0.1` works fine; for distributed deployments, use publicly reachable IPs or hostnames for both the orchestrator and each worker.
