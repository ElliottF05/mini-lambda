# mini-lambda
A lightweight, Rust-powered serverless compute platform for running WebAssembly anywhere.

### IMPORTANT NOTE:
I plan on using this as the final project in one of my classes, so can't release code publicly due to academic honesty. Please reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliottfaa/) or [email](mailto:elliotthfaa@gmail.com) if you want more details about the project, I'd love to discuss!
